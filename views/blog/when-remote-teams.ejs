                        <p>COVID proved that remote-work works. When the pandemic struck, every possible job worked successfully remotely. And now, most companies realize the tremendous potential remote teams provide but are not sure if that change can be permanent.</p>
                        <p>We have been building successful remote teams for over a decade now. Over the years, we have learned when remote works and when it does not. Here are a few of our thoughts about working with remote teams.</p>
                        <p>Following are five must-haves, in our opinion, to make remote work -</p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>All collaborative meetings must be remote unless ALL participants are meeting in person.</li>
                                <li>Processes and workflows must aim to eliminate the need for most transactional communications. For example, there shouldn't be any need to ask or meet for the status of anything. You should be able to look it up to find out.</li>
                                <li>The two-pizza rule does not work well with remote. The ideal size for all meetings should be four or less, except standup and all-hands.</li>
                                <li>Turning on videos during all meetings is essential. Even 1-1, impromptu ping-and-meet, jump-in-my-room meetings should be with video.</li>
                                <li>The tools you use must be collaborative to the core. And they matter a lot. At SleekSky, we prefer Google Workspace, Slack, Figma, and Github. Avoid any file-based tools.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>In-person meetings are great, but once you make the above 5 points a norm, online sessions will almost always be more productive than in-person. In-person meetings would be limited to inter-personal relationship building and developing shared experiences.</p>
                        <p>So as a company, are you ready for remote teams?</p>
                        <p>Remote though may not be for everyone, and here are a few reasons why -
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your work requires a physical lab or specialized hardware</li>
                            <li>Work is done more via a <i>talk-and-do</i> approach rather than <i>task-and-do</i></li>
                            <li>You do not have mature enough processes yet to measure productivity objectively</li>
                            <li>Your culture has not evolved yet where people can get online and meet on video calls
                            </li>
                            <li>It doesn't feel like an organization without an office full of people!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are some obvious benefits when you adopt the remote mantra. It is not without effort, and it does require change, mainly with culture, processes, and accountability. And those can be hard. But when you do, the benefits will far outweigh what you give up.</p>
